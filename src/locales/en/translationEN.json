      "description": "Born and raised in Piteå, Norrbotten County. Since 2016, I have been living in Stockholm and currently deepening my skills as a Frontend Developer with a focus on web security at Jensen Vocational College in Kista. Belonging to the FWK23S class, I am expected to complete my education in the summer of 2025. My lifelong interest in computers has been a driving force that now leads me toward a career in a field that I find both extremely fascinating and interesting. I am seeking an internship from the fall of 2024 for a period of six months to further deepen my knowledge and gain practical experience.",
